# Normal-path-to-automating-stuff
My quest to automate every manual task I have to do at work!
Starting with - Amazon Ads!

## Project Overview
In this project, I've tackled the challenge of cleaning and organizing advertising data from Amazon. Managing two ad accounts with diverse brands and campaign types meant dealing with a lot of complex data. Initially, I tried Excel, but it was like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - not very efficient and prone to crashing. So, I turned to Python, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer!

### What's Inside
You'll find two main Jupyter notebook files (Sponsored Product Search term report Amazon Ads.ipynb and Sponsored Brand advertised report products Amazon Ads.ipynb) in this repository:

Sponsored Product Search term report Amazon Ads.ipynb: This is where the magic starts! It contains the code I developed to automate the data cleaning process starting with search term report which I found gave me most of what I nade to make optimization decisions. It significantly reduced the cleaning time from hours to mere seconds.

Sponsored Brand advertised report products Amazon Ads.ipynb: Here I needed to clean reports that contained the ASINs we , the task was to identify the brand and ASIN performance. Filled with fun challenges and many head scratching moments!

Also, there's a .py file for those who prefer a straight-up script version.

The Process
Let me walk you through the gist of it:

Data Cleaning: The main focus was on efficiently cleaning various sheets. I dealt with challenges like handling Arabic characters, converting data into a format ready for analysis, extracting data, creating new columns for better reporting and combining multiple files to get the desired result.

Automation: Automating this task saved me not just time but also the headache of manual processing.

Why This Matters
If you've ever dealt with data, you know it's rarely in the format you need. This project is a real-world example of taking messy, real-world data and whipping it into shape, making it analysis-ready.

How to Use
Feel free to explore the notebooks and code. You can clone this repository, run the notebooks, and see how it all comes together. Maybe it'll inspire you for your next data cleaning adventure!
